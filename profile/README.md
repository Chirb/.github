# Chirb

## A short introduction

Chirb is a project that transforms video/audio content into easily readable and comprehensive notes. It incorporates accurate punctuation and organizes the text into appropriate paragraphs.

We offer a service akin to YouTube Video Chapters. Our capability includes segmenting full video or audio content into appropriate chapters and identifying the timestamps marking the start and end of each chapter. This feature facilitates convenient navigation to specific segments within the video or audio content that you wish to access.
